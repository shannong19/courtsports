## `gs_players`

```{r}
data(gs_players)
dim(gs_players)
```

The data contained in `gs_players` is extracted from Jeff Sackman's tennis repository via the `R deuce` package and shown here for convenience.  It consists of *all* non-qualifying round grandslam matches between 2013-2017.  There are 127 matches in each round (which will appear twice, one for each player of reference), two leagues,  four grandslams per year, and five years.  The help files from both these sources are useful resources to exploring the data.
